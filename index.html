      <p class="bio" id="tribute-info">Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-born American actress and inventor.</p>
      <div></div>
      <p class="intro" ><b>A timeline of her life:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna.</li>
        <li>As a child, Lamarr showed an interest in acting and was fascinated by theater and film. </li>
        <li>She also began to learn about technological inventions with her father, who would explain how devices functioned.</li>
        <li>In early 1933, at age 18, Lamarr was given the lead in Gustav Machat√Ω's film Ecstasy</li>
        <li>Lamarr played a number of stage roles, including a starring one in Sissy, a play about Empress Elisabeth of Austria produced in Vienna</li>
        <li>On August 10, 1933, Lamarr married Friedrich Mandl, an Austrian military arms merchant and munitions manufacturer who was reputedly the third-richest man in Austria, at the Karlskirche. She was 18 years old and he was 33.</li>
        <li>Lamarr accompanied Mandl to business meetings, where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology. These conferences were her introduction to the field of applied science and nurtured her latent talent in science.</li>
        <li>Lamarr's marriage to Mandl eventually became unbearable, and she decided to separate herself from both her husband and country in 1937.</li>
        <li>She never attended engineering school but, together with avant-garde composer George Antheil, secured a patent for frequency hopping technology in 1942, intended to help torpedoes hit German submarine targets.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Lamarr became a naturalized citizen of the United States at age 38 on April 10, 1953. Her autobiography, Ecstasy and Me, was published in 1966.</li>
        <li>Lamarr died in Casselberry, Florida, on January 19, 2000, of heart disease, aged 85</li>
